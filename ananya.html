  <p class="description">Have you ever heard of U.K. House Music? U.K. House Music is what is played in clubs by DJs. House music was created in and by the African American community. It has origins in gospel, soul, and funk. The house music came to the U.K. as Chicago House Music. Speaking of which, in Chicago, the Warehouse is one of the most popular places to listen to house music. Larry Levan was the first person to suggest creating the Warehouse. Although he was the first to think of it, Levan only worked in New Yorkâ€™s Paradise Garage, instead. Another important person in House music was Frankie Knuckles. Knuckles, also known as the Godfather of House, mixed, matched, and experimented with sounds. Above is a piece of what could be U.K. House Music, created by Sri Ananya Paladugu.</p>
